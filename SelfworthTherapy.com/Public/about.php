        Self-Worth therapy is based in Stamullen and was founded in 15 July 2022 to provide therapy and consultation.
        Self-Worth was developed by Marvelous Olabinjo.
        It is an approach to living and managing difficulties that is rooted in human evolution, neuroscience, and psychological theory.

        <br><br>

        Self-worth therapy has been shown to be helpful for a range of issues, including anxiety and depression.
        Self-worth therapy is most helpful when one's difficulties are maintained by patterns of self-criticism and shame. <br>
        Self-worth helps us to realise that much of what causes us to suffer is not our fault.
        At the same time, Self-worth therapy helps us take responsibility, in a compassionate way, for what we can change

        In Self-worth therapy, you will spend time learning to understand your emotions and motivations.
        You will be supported in exploring the difficulties that you face in a caring way with the aim of developing
        a more compassionate relationship with yourself.
        Your therapist will work with you to harness your own innate strength,
        wisdom, courage, and commitment to bring about the changes that you want to see in your life.
